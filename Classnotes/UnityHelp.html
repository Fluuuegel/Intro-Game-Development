<h3><strong>Download and Installation</strong></h3>
<p>Unity download and install: work with the latest, all examples in class are based on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Unity-2021.3.2f1</strong></span> (LTS: Long Term Support releases):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases">https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases</a>. Under <strong>Long Term Support</strong> select: <i>Unity 2021 LTS</i>:
<ul>
<li>Download 
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LTS Release 2021 LTS</strong></span>.  
     Do not be overly concerned with the exact release, one of the LTS from 2019 and beyond will do.
</li> 
<li>Modules to install:
    <ul>
        <li><b>IDE</b>: I will be using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code (VSC)</a>.
                With VSC, here is the 
                <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Unity.unity-debug">
                debugger extension for Unity.</a>
                You are free to use anything IDE you like, 
                the default IDE for Unity is Microsoft Visual Studio Community, which works very well also.</li>
        <li><b>WebGL Build Support</b>: Please make sure to install this module 
                for our playtesting (for part-2 of this class will be based on WebGL builds. 
                Additionally, if you are running on a Mac, please also install <b>Windows Build Support</b> 
                such that you can build for PC EXE and the TA can run your assignment submissions. </li>
        <li><b>Documentation</b>: I would advice installing this as well.
